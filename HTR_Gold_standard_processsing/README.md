# Gold Standard Workflow (Needs further development)

This directory uses the same files as ../HTR, so you just need to port what the scripts do in HTR. Again, it uses the same exact scripts as HTR, the only difference is this data is not used to train the models, but to test their performance only. This entails a few things like not needing to split to multiple partitions (train, val and test) and the images not needing to be rotated (augmentation for the detector model). At the time of writing this documentation, Gold standard data has not been completely labeled so none of the scripts in this directory are by stretch completed.
